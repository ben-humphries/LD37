Entry for Ludum Dare 37

DISCLAIMER:
The code in this project is the epitome of unorganization and sloppiness! Throughout the course of the 48 hours, I changed my mind a lot on what the final product would look like, so there are left over scraps and snip-its that probably aren't needed or aren't completely efficient. In the interest of time, I didn't comment it, but maybe sometime when I'm not exhausted I'll go back and do that so it's more understandable.
